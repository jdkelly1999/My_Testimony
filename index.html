                        For a long time I was an atheist. My life took a turn for the worse and I gradually became more agnostic, even believing the universe was a highly complex simulation due to the highly **improbable** events I experienced.
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-blue-700">
                        I started **receiving** extremely serious, credible threats. I quickly went to moderate and even tried to delete my Reddit (shamed to admit). I could not find out how so I gave up. Suddenly, dozens of messages appeared as my own, that I had never written. Most said "Mona Lisa", but there were others that included Chinese and pictures.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many odd and bizarre events **occurred** after. Often with perfect timing. The messages of "mine" even updated as I spoke to my mother. Let's just say, God doesn't like terrorism one bit. Many strange things happened for weeks. On the day of my confession to God, my stopwatch on my basic digital watch could no longer be stopped, it only ran or paused. It is "running for eternity". Make of this what you will. **My vision/glasses suddenly got better!**

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6 border-b pt-6 pb-2 border-t mt-12">First Day Main Miracles/Works</h2>
                <article class="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                        I was very active on social media platforms like X and Reddit, often getting involved in intense discussions, trying to be fair to both sides and minimize harm. Eventually, I found myself drawn into the trap of polarizing discourse, even though I never intended to align with literal extremism. I saw posts from highly agitated people and encountered unusual math problems that I inexplicably could not solve, despite typically excelling in mathematics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began receiving extreme threats that made me feel profoundly unsafe. I decided to moderate my content and then attempted to delete my Reddit account. I posted three final moderating statements. I manually liked one, and immediately, the other two were automatically liked as well. Suddenly, dozens of messages appeared. The top two messages read, "death to terrorists." Many others simply said, "Mona Lisa." One was a picture of a woman with her mouth horrifyingly open.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am sometimes a chatterbox. One message appeared in Chinese, referencing my earlier comment that "the Chinese deal with problems." When I spoke to my mother, the automatically generated messages updated again, mirroring my own conversational style and mentioning that punishment was necessary for terrorists. One message specifically referred to me as "a fruit that is not that bad," perhaps referencing my occasionally "fruity" demeanor, but implying others were far worse. Earlier, my mother had sent me a recording of a Mass which deeply resonated with me. Following the "fruit" comment, a message came through with a specific reference to my grandfather needing an implant for A-fib.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        **All of these simultaneous, impossible events**—the sudden, specific threats, the automatically generated messages mirroring my private conversations, the highly personal family health reference, and the surreal imagery—left no doubt in my mind that an intelligence far beyond human was intervening. The combination of hyper-specific, real-time data and a clear moral message was the catalyst that forced me away from agnostic doubt and toward confession and full surrender.

                <article class="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                        The miraculous and bizarre occurrences did not end after the first day; they continued to unfold over the **next month**, serving as constant reminders and course corrections. These events ranged from forced changes in my physical environment to direct digital interference, all pushing me toward focus, faith, and away from distractions. These "works and oddities" felt like continuous guidance through unconventional means:

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 text-gray-700">
                        <li>**Headphone Volume:** My headphones suddenly locked at a very high volume on my Chromebook while I was listening to K-Love and Tony Evans.</li>
                        <li>**Refusing to Save:** A Bible study app I was building started simply refusing to save, suggesting a shift from reliance on technology to manual writing.</li>
                        <li>**Computer Locked:** My laptop, which I often used for unproductive activity, suddenly became inaccessible after a routine update, forcing me to shift my focus.</li>
                        <li>**Swipe Marks:** When I argued against sharing the miracles I was experiencing, bizarre black swipe marks appeared over my phone's screen keyboard, and gibberish was typed out.</li>
                        <li>**Rewriting Messages:** Text messages would rewrite themselves on my phone from what I had initially typed.</li>
                        <li>**Headphone Light:** The light on my wireless headphones got intensely bright. I accidentally left them on near my bed.</li>
                        <li>**Phone Scrolling:** My phone screen would scroll up and down on its own.</li>
                        <li>**Email Redirected:** An email intended for my mother regarding Nextdoor was mysteriously redirected to my inbox.</li>
                        <li>**Message Duplication:** Text messages I sent were duplicated, with the duplicated messages having a deeper personal meaning.</li>
                        <li>**Radio Phone Number:** A phone number announced on K-Love changed when the announcer repeated it a second time.</li>
                        <li>**Donation Volume:** When I tried to donate to Shine-FM, the radio volume suddenly increased significantly and an advertisement began to play.</li>
                        <li>**Autofill:** The autofill function generated highly specific and detailed job descriptions based on very minimal input.</li>
                        <li>**Autocorrect:** The autocorrect function occasionally changed the entire sentence to convey a completely different meaning.</li>
                        <li class="new-addition">**Glasses Wipes:** Suddenly, a package of glasses wipes appeared on my desk out of nowhere, providing **<span class="metric">1 unit of logistical provision</span>** for my recently improved eyesight.</li>

                        <li>**Stopwatch: Running for Eternity.** My simple digital watch's stopwatch suddenly could not be stopped. Instead of a start/stop function, both buttons only served to pause it. The watch updates at a high frequency in the centi-seconds, affirming a **<span class="metric">0-second delay</span>** in God’s guidance and a **<span class="metric">100% availability</span>** of connection.</li>
                        <li>**The Black Dogs:** Shortly after an acorn fell on my leg, three identical, well-muscled black dogs walked past me. As I continued walking, two of them turned, began barking and growling, and started following me. I continued without fear, and they suddenly turned and retreated.</li>
                        <li>**Ex-Drug Dealer Encounter:** A man drove up and asked if I knew anyone hiring. After I said no, he voluntarily shared his past, mentioning he was an ex-drug dealer. I told him it was okay, and that God was working on him. We shook hands, and he drove off, mentioning he was now in the church choir.</li>
                        <li>**Overcome with the Holy Spirit: The <span class="metric">100% Immersion Event</span>.** I was overcome with the Holy Spirit for about an hour. This was a **<span class="metric">total physical and mental takeover</span>** of consciousness, confirming the divine source with overwhelming intensity. I wrote many things, much in Psalm-style, affirming my commitment to God and the coming justice.</li>
                        <li class="new-addition">**Spiritual War Zone:** During a period of heightened focus (Mass/Prayer), I distinctly felt that **Satan and his whole army** were fighting against the combined force of God, the Angels, and myself, confirming the **<span class="metric">100% reality of spiritual warfare</span>** and the necessity of constant Divine defense.</li>
