                    <p>
                        <!-- START OF YOUR TESTIMONY -->My life was once defined by a constant seeking: a search for purpose, security, and true belonging that always left me feeling empty. I chased success and material comfort, believing those things would finally satisfy the deep ache in my soul. Every achievement, however, was quickly overshadowed by the next goal, leaving me exhausted and increasingly isolated.
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-blue-700">
                        Then came the moment of realization. It wasn't a sudden, dramatic event, but a slow, quiet conviction that the path I was on was leading nowhere. I realized I needed a completely new direction, something that offered more than temporary fixes. This pivotal point changed everything, leading me to seek out the truth that I had avoided for so long.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I found that true fulfillment wasn't in what I could earn or control, but in surrendering that control. My faith journey started simply, with small steps of reading, connecting with others, and allowing myself to be open to grace. The peace I found wasn't the absence of struggle, but the presence of a steady hope that grounded me through every challenge.
