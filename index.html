                        <!-- START OF YOUR TESTIMONY --> For a long time I was an atheist. My life took a turn for the worse and I gradually became more agnostic, even believing the universe was a highly complex simulation due to the highly **improbable** events I experienced.
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-blue-700">
                        I started **receiving** extremely serious, credible threats. I quickly went to moderate and even tried to delete my Reddit (shamed to admit). I could not find out how so I gave up. Suddenly, dozens of messages appeared as my own, that I had never written. Most said "Mona Lisa", but there were others that included Chinese and pictures.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many odd and bizarre events **occurred** after. Often with perfect timing. The messages of "mine" even updated as I spoke to my mother. Let's just say, God doesn't like terrorism one bit. Many strange things happened for weeks. On the day of my confession to God, my stopwatch on my basic digital watch could no longer be stopped, it only ran or paused. It is "running for eternity". Make of this what you will. **My vision/glasses suddenly got better!**
                        <!-- END OF YOUR TESTIMONY -->
